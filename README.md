# NO2 Power Price Forecasting

This project was a group project in the Energy Data Analysis Module of UCL's masters in Energy Systems and Data Analytics. The project aims to predict day-ahead electricity prices for the NO2 zone in Norway, leveraging data from the ENTSO-E API and testing the performance of various machine learning models. 

## Features Used

- **Day-Ahead Electricity Prices** (target variable)
- **Load Forecasts** (NO2 + neighboring zones)
- **Wind & Solar Forecasts**
- **Generation Forecasts**
- **Net Transfer Capacities (NTC)** across borders
- **Physical Cross-Border Flows**

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- entsoe-py for ENTSO-E API access
- Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM for prediction
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
